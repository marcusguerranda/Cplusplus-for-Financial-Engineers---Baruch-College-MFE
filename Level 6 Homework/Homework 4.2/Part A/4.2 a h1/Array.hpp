/*          Tip: by placing the following code at the end of the array header file (see line 50 to 52 in this source file), but before the header 
            fileâ€™s #endif, the client can keep including the header file for template classes instead of the 
            source file. Can you explain how this works?:


To my understanding, this 'issue' is not so much a matter required by the standard itself, but rather by the compilers we use.
With a normal function, the code would be defined in a header file, and implemented in a source file. This source file would then be subsequently written out to an object file, 
created when compiling that function.

However with a template function, the compiler cannot compile it into an object code for any object type ahead of time. That said, the implementation of the template class
needs to be known at compile-time and not at link-time. In order to do so, we include the .cpp file into the .hpp file, and include the .hpp file in main.cpp. Guards are used 
to avoid defining the template twice.
